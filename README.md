# THE-JOKEANATOR-3000
This project is a small hardware joke machine built with an Arduino, a rotary encoder, and an SH1106 OLED display. Turning the rotary knob scrolls through a list of jokes, and pressing the knob shows the punchline. The jokes and answers are stored in PROGMEM so the device can hold many jokes while using very little memory.
