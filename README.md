# THE-JOKEANATOR-3000
This project is a small hardware joke machine built with an Arduino, a rotary encoder, and an SH1106 OLED display. Turning the rotary knob scrolls through a list of jokes, and pressing the knob shows the punchline. All jokes and answers are stored in PROGMEM so the device can hold many jokes while using very little memory.

By the way, this project was a blast to make. thanks for taking the time to check it out!
